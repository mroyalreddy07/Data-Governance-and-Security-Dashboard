# Data-Governance-and-Security-Dashboard

The World Bank’s ESG Data Draft dataset provides information on 17 key sustainability themes spanning environmental, social, and governance categories. In order to shift financial flows so that they are better aligned with global goals, the World Bank Group (WBG) is working to provide financial markets with improved data and analytics that shed light on countries’ sustainability performance. Along with new
information and tools, the World Bank will also develop research on the correlation between countries’ sustainability performance and the risk and return profiles of relevant investments.
